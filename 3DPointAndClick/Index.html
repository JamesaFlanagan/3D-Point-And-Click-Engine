            Rectanguloids are a species that look like rectangles.
        </p>
        <p>
            There genetics are very simple and their children are always the same colour as the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunetly, Rectanguloids are colour blind and find it hard to tell their children apart from other children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Help the Rectanguloids be reunited correctly my clicking on their child.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ThatIsTheParent" class="infotext" hidden="">
        <p>
            That is the parent. Click on the child that matches the colour of this Rectanguloid.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ThatIsTheWrongChild" class="infotext" hidden="">
        <p>
            That is the wrong child.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have doomed this poor family to raise the wrong child - which will eventually grow to resent it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ThatIsTheCorrectChild" class="infotext" hidden="">
        <p>
            That is the correct child.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have made the family whole again, and they will surely go on to have a happy life.
